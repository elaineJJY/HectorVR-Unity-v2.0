	abstract = {This paper presents a highly interactive and immersive Virtual Reality Training System (VRTS) (``beWare of the Robot'') in terms of a serious game that simulates in real-time the cooperation between industrial robotic manipulators and humans, executing simple manufacturing tasks. The scenario presented refers to collaborative handling in tape-laying for building aerospace composite parts. The tools, models and techniques developed and used to build the ``beWare of the Robot''application are described. System setup and configuration are presented in detail, as well as user tracking and navigation issues. Special emphasis is given to the interaction techniques used to facilitate implementation of virtual human--robot (HR) collaboration. Safety issues, such as contacts and collisions are mainly tackled through ``emergencies'', i.e. warning signals in terms of visual stimuli and sound alarms. Mental safety is of utmost priority and the user is provided augmented situational awareness and enhanced perception of the robot's motion due to immersion and real-time interaction offered by the VRTS as well as by special warning stimuli. The short-term goal of the research was to investigate users'enhanced experience and behaviour inside the virtual world while cooperating with the robot and positive pertinent preliminary findings are presented and briefly discussed. In the longer term, the system can be used to investigate acceptability of H--R collaboration and, ultimately, serve as a platform for programming collaborative H--R manufacturing cells.},

@article{Perez:2019ub,
	abstract = {Nowadays, we are involved in the fourth industrial revolution, commonly referred to as ``Industry 4.0,''where cyber-physical systems and intelligent automation, including robotics, are the keys. Traditionally, the use of robots has been limited by safety and, in addition, some manufacturing tasks are too complex to be fully automated. Thus, human-robot collaborative applications, where robots are not isolated, are necessary in order to increase the productivity ensuring the safety of the operators with new perception systems for the robot and new interaction interfaces for the human. Moreover, virtual reality has been extended to the industry in the last years, but most of its applications are not related to robots. In this context, this paper works on the synergies between virtual reality and robotics, presenting the use of commercial gaming technologies to create a totally immersive environment based on virtual reality. This environment includes an interface connected to the robot controller, where the necessary mathematical models have been implemented for the control of the virtual robot. The proposed system can be used for training, simulation, and what is more innovative, for robot controlling in an integrated, non-expensive and unique application. Results show that the immersive experience increments the efficiency of the training and simulation processes, offering a cost-effective solution.},

	abstract = {A crucial skill for fluent action meshing in human team activity is a learned and calculated selection of anticipatory actions. We believe that the same holds for robotic teammates, if they are to perform in a similarly fluent manner with their human counterparts.In this work, we propose an adaptive action selection mechanism for a robotic teammate, making anticipatory decisions based on the confidence of their validity and their relative risk. We predict an improvement in task efficiency and fluency compared to a purely reactive process.We then present results from a study involving untrained human subjects working with a simulated version of a robot using our system. We show a significant improvement in best-case task efficiency when compared to a group of users working with a reactive agent, as well as a significant difference in the perceived commitment of the robot to the team and its contribution to the team's uency and success. By way of explanation, we propose a number of fluency metrics that differ significantly between the two study groups.},

@article{SOARES20151656,
	abstract = {The remote handling (RH) plays an important role in nuclear test facilities, such as in ITER, for in-vessel and ex-vessel maintenance operations. Unexpected situations may occur when RH devices fail. Since no human being is allowed during the RH operations, a Multi-purpose Rescue Vehicle (MPRV) must be required for providing support in site. This paper proposes a design of a MPRV, i.e., a mobile platform equipped with different sensors and two manipulators with different sets of end-effectors. A human--machine interface is also proposed to remotely operate the MPRV and to carry out rescue and recovery operations.},
